# asm-fizzbuzz
fizzbuzz written in x86_64 assembly, for gnu/linux. probably also works on
other mostly-posix-compliant™ unices.

## usage
```
fizzbuzz <arg>
```
arg is the upper bound and is expected to be a number in decimal system. it is
also necessary for the program to do anything.

## installation
not really sure why you would need it, but here you go:
```
make all
```
and then `bin` directory will appear with an executable. if for some reason you 
wanted to have it in your path, then easiest way would be to link to it in
`/usr/bin`.

## how to make pizza dough
ingredients:
- 25g of fresh yeast
- 150ml of water
- tablespoon of sugar
- tablespoon of potato starch
- 250g of wheat flour
- spoon of salt
- tablespoon of olive oil

heat the water up to around 30 degrees C, then put sugar and potato starch to
it and stir well until it dissolves. next break yeast into small pieces and
add it to water. let it sit for around 15 minutes.

mix flour with salt and put it into a bowl. then pour the yeast-water mixture
into it and mix it, adding the olive oil. MIX IT WELL. use your hands. it
should take around 15 minutes.

leave it for around an hour, use this time to prepare all the stuff you will
put on your pizza. after that time the dough is ready.
